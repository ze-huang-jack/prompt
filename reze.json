        "visual_details": "Reze stands in a relaxed, slightly playful pose, positioned centrally on the board. Her short dark-green hair is rendered using layered dark chalk with subtle white accents to capture the sheen and volume. Her expression mixes gentleness and danger, with carefully shaded eyes and a faint, ambiguous smile. She wears her familiar school-uniform-inspired outfit: a white shirt with rolled sleeves (light gray and white chalk for folds), a black tie (dense dark chalk hatching), and a dark skirt with controlled shading to show movement. A thin line of red chalk traces the subtle collar bomb motif around her neck, blending into the chalk texture. Her left hand rests casually by her side while her right hand lightly touches her hair, suggesting a moment of disarming ease. Shading is created through visible hatching and cross-hatching to emphasize form, with soft smudging on the shirt and hair for blended texture.",
        "medium_texture": "The dusty, matte quality of chalk is preserved throughout. Hair and clothing contours show clear chalk stroke direction. Smudged areas on the green slate indicate hand-blended tones, especially around the face, collar, and shirt folds."
