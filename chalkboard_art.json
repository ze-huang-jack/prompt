        "primary_subject": "A large-scale, intricate chalk drawing of Kizaru (Borsalino) from 'One Piece' on a standard green classroom blackboard.",
        "visual_details": "The illustration depicts Kizaru standing in a relaxed yet imposing pose, positioned centrally on the board. He has his characteristic droopy eyes and calm, almost lazy expression, wearing his round sunglasses. His short, dark curly hair is rendered with dense application of dark chalk with subtle white accents for sheen. He is dressed in his iconic yellow, vertically pinstriped suit with an orange tie, over which a white Marine admiral coat is draped like a cape, suggested by flowing lines of white and pale gray chalk. One hand is raised casually, fingers extended as if about to fire a beam of light, with stylized radiating light motifs drawn using bright yellow and white chalk around his hand. Careful hatching and cross-hatching define the folds and volume of his suit and coat.",
        "medium_texture": "The image preserves the dusty, matte quality of the chalk. Visible hatching and cross-hatching strokes create shading on his clothing and hair. Smudged areas on the green slate indicate where colors have been blended by hand, especially in the yellow suit and the glowing light effects.",
        "surrounding_elements": "To the right of the character, vertical Japanese text reading '海軍大将 黄猿' is written in crisp white chalk."

        "foreground_elements": "A wooden teacher's desk occupies the lower foreground. Scattered across the surface are a yellow box of colored chalks, loose sticks of red, white, and blue pastel chalk, and a dust-covered black felt eraser.",
        "background_elements": "The green chalkboard spans the width of the frame, bordered by a metallic chalk tray containing accumulated chalk dust. The wall above is a plain, off-white plaster, featuring a small mounted speaker box.",
